# Semantic Layer PoC Repository

All project assets live under invoice_semantic_layer/. Start with the documentation to understand the PoC structure.

Recommended reading:
1. [invoice_semantic_layer/docs/README.md](invoice_semantic_layer/docs/README.md) - master deployment guide and document map.
2. [invoice_semantic_layer/docs/01_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](invoice_semantic_layer/docs/01_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) - high-level architecture summary.
3. [invoice_semantic_layer/docs/10_DAB_DEPLOYMENT_README.md](invoice_semantic_layer/docs/10_DAB_DEPLOYMENT_README.md) - step-by-step instructions for executing infra/databricks.yml.

For a quick run:
- SQL scripts: invoice_semantic_layer/sql_semantic_poc/
- Automation config: invoice_semantic_layer/infra/databricks.yml
- Genie benchmark notebook: invoice_semantic_layer/notebooks/Benchmark_Questions.sql

Every supporting document (architecture, deployment flow, Genie setup, runbook, etc.) is numbered in invoice_semantic_layer/docs/ for easy navigation.
